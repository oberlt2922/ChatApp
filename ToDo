//Things to do
	Validation
		isPublic is required
		chatroomName is required and max length is 40
		usernames are not required
			make sure that the user does not try to add themselves
			make sure that the user does not try to add another user twice
			make sure that the user does not try to add a non-existent user
		autocomplete usernames
			when creating chatroom, adding members, and blocking users
			dont show current user
		options:
			Viewmodel (server side validation)
				pros:  can use asp-validation-for spans
				cons:  might not be able to check usernames with asp-validation-for, might not be able to set modelstate and display error messages from controller
			Ajax functions (client side validation)
				pros:	Could easily check all inputs
				cons:	Will most likely have to make an ajax call for every input elemet so that individual error messages can be displayed and hidden, might be slow and inefficient
				Try one ajax call and return a collection of booleans in the same order as all of the hidden error messages then for each bool that is true, display correct error message
