//Things to do
	message from other users says undefined instead of the username
		also sometimes the message sender and time info is two lines instead of one and is on top of the message itself instead of underneath.
	Footer gets in the way when window size is adjusted
	automatically display most recent chatroom
	User should not be able to add themselves when creating a new chatroom
	Validation
		check chatroom name
		check if member exists or if it is current user
		autocomplete
			dont show current user
	Anti Forgery Tokens
	Cascade delete
	new message tag on chatroom list
		add timestamp to appuserChatroom table
	add action menu items when display chatroom is called
	When the user scrolls up in the chatroom, detach (make it so that the chatroom does not automatically scroll down) and display an element to 
		reatach(scrolls to bottom every time a message comes in)
	add custom scrollbar to chatroom list
	if word is too long handle text overflow
	only send message if there is an active chatroom
