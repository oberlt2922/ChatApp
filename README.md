# MyChatApp
 
This is a chat application.  The application will use MVC Core with Entity Framework Core and SignalR to allow 
users to send and recieve messages in real time.


By the time the website is finished, it should have these features:

When the user first loads the website they will be able to sign up and sing in.

After signing in they will see a page that displays all of the chatrooms that they are in.

Users can choose to leave a chatroom.

The creator of the chatroom can delete it.

There will be a search bar to search for users to chat with.

There will be a create chatroom button where a user can create a chatroom and select users to add to the chat room.

The chatrooms will have the user's messages on the right side and the other users' messages on the other side.

The chatrooms will have an add user and remove user button.
