# MyChatApp
 
This is a chat application.  The application uses ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core and SignalR to allow 
users to send and recieve messages in real time.


Users can register and login.  
After logging in a bootstrap template is used to display a list of all the chatrooms that they are members of on the left,
and a panel on the right to display the active chatroom.  
Users can create new chatrooms, search for public chatrooms to join, send messages, leave chatrooms, and delete chatrooms if they are the admin.  
In the future, users will be able to block users from the chatroom and invite other users to the chatroom if they are the admin of the chatroom.
